# IBM IDA LDM Sanity Checking Tool

A GUI-based Python utility for validating IBM InfoSphere Data Architect (IDA) Logical Data Model (LDM) and Naming Standard Model (NDM) XML files. The tool helps data architects and modelers quickly identify common compliance issues in data models and generates a detailed sanity report.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Domain and Data Type Extraction:** Lists all domain values and their base data types used in the LDM.
- **Attribute Length Check:** Identifies columns with names longer than 30 characters.
- **Abbreviation Compliance:** Detects missing abbreviations in the NDM file for attribute names.
- **Description Completeness:** Flags attributes that lack descriptions.
- **Domain Usage Check:** Finds attributes not assigned to a domain.
- **Comprehensive Report:** Outputs all findings to a timestamped text file.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Simple Tkinter interface for file selection and report generation.
